<h1>Zen-Cart-Local-Delivery-Module</h1>
<p>This module was developed thinking of a grocery store. It adds a timetable during checkout, in order to let the customer select which time he wants the goods delivered.</p>
<p>The store administrator can set the cost and maximum number of deliveries for each time slot (default value and special value).<p>
<p>The time slot will become automaticly unavailable to customers once it reaches the maximum number of orders as set by the store administrator.</p>
<p>Customers can also 'reserve' a time-slot even before starting the checkot process, to make sure that no other customers will take their desired timeslot while shopping.</p>
<p>This module is based on the osCommerce module found <a href"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/4530">here</a></p>
